# Starting the new year 
*(10-1-25)*
I am driven to make this sight for 2 main reasons, its the begining of the new year meaning I have a new internal drive to get stuff done (new year new me etc.) and alongside that I have chosen to not take the web development module offered at my university (for multiple reasons) even though I wanted to. Following up on this I thought it useful to be able to understand the principles of web development so thought it best to try and learn it on my own! 

I have completed some web-based projects before, namely the [dean game](https://errorfouroneeight.github.io/deangame.html), which is a game my family has played for a while and the online tool has become a staple of chirstmas gatherings! 

Either way I hope to post many new projects here (as well as my actual [github page](https://github.com/errorfouroneeight))!

Welcome 2025 :)
